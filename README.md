**A/B Insights.ai: Your Data-Driven Product Optimization Hub**
This is a simple, yet powerful, website I've put together to explore and explain A/B testing, specifically tailored for Product Managers and AI Product Managers. My goal was to create a clean, modern, and visually engaging resource that helps demystify the world of experimentation.

**What is this about?**
This website dives into the fundamentals of A/B testing, guiding you through its core principles, framework, and best practices. It's designed to help product folks like us make more informed, data-driven decisions.

**Key Features**
Comprehensive A/B Testing Framework: A step-by-step guide to running effective experiments.

Insights for Product Managers: Focuses on practical advice and common pitfalls.

AI Product Management Deep Dive: Addresses the unique challenges and metrics when A/B testing AI/ML features.

Interactive Charts: Visual representations to make complex data easier to understand.

AI-Powered Hypothesis & Metric Generators: Tools integrated directly into the site to help you formulate strong hypotheses and suggest relevant metrics for your AI features (powered by Google's Gemini API).

Modern UI/UX: A clean design with a versatile light and a neon-inspired dark mode, drawing inspiration from high-end brand websites.

**Built With**
HTML: For structuring the content.

Tailwind CSS: For sleek, responsive styling.

Chart.js: For interactive data visualizations.

JavaScript: For dynamic functionalities and integrating the AI models.

**How to Run It Locally**
This project is super easy to run! It's just a single HTML file:

Clone or Download: Get the index.html file (or the entire project folder if you have it) to your local machine.

Open with Browser: Simply double-click the index.html file, and it will open in your default web browser.

Alternatively, you can open it with a live server extension in VS Code for a more streamlined development experience.

**A Note on AI Features**
The AI-powered "Hypothesis Generator" and "AI Metric Suggester" are connected to the Google Gemini API. If you wish to use a different large language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo), you can adjust the apiKey and apiUrl variables within the JavaScript section of the index.html file to point to your preferred API and configure the payload accordingly.

**Why I Built This**
I built this project to showcase my understanding of A/B testing principles and my ability to integrate modern web development practices with AI functionalities. It's a personal project aiming to provide valuable insights in a user-friendly format.

Feel free to explore and leverage the insights for your own product optimization journey!
